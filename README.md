Rewind VM runs a Nix build, a test suite or any Linux command inside a KVM
virtual machine whose every run is a function of its inputs. The same inputs
give the same run, at the same steps, every time. A failure you saw once is a
failure you keep: replay it, scrub through it step by step, read any file as it
was at any step, and fork it with a different thread interleaving from any
point.

```console
$ rewind check github:fzakaria/rewindvm#mylib
schedule   0: exited:0       6169 steps  a9d703ba8977  run 6380bb57fcb451da
schedule   1: exited:0       7202 steps  a9d703ba8977  run e5003a7041880029
schedule   2: exited:0       7233 steps  a9d703ba8977  run 70416cb698a5d521
...
schedule   6: exited:2       5468 steps    run 1506c6347419c2d2
...

schedule 6 ends differently; narrowing the steps it perturbs
perturbing only steps 3629..5140 still ends differently
step 5139 decides it: a reschedule there makes the run fail

passing: run 1989f6d02c080616, schedule 6 over steps 3629..5139
failing: run 5c910df9774b38f2, schedule 6 over steps 3629..5140
the two are the same run until step 5139

where ./tests/test_pool_shutdown first behaves differently:
  ...
  both           5150   166/174   write(1, "job 15 done: 42559\n")
  failing        5153   166/174   SIGSEGV code=1 addr=0x108
  failing        5155   166/166   SIGSEGV code=0 addr=0x0
  passing        5151   166/174   write(1, "worker picked job 18\n")
  passing        5162   166/173   write(1, "job 17 done: 43360\n")

$ rewind events 5c910df9 | grep SIGSEGV
      5153   166/174   SIGSEGV code=1 addr=0x108
...

$ rewind replay 5c910df9
identical: 1713 events over 5192 steps
```

## Install

On x86_64 Linux with KVM:

```console
$ curl -fsSL https://rewindvm.dev/install | sh
```

With Nix, run it straight from the flake, or install it into your profile:

```console
$ nix run github:fzakaria/rewindvm -- pmu status
$ nix run github:fzakaria/rewindvm#app
$ nix profile install github:fzakaria/rewindvm github:fzakaria/rewindvm#app
```

On NixOS, add the flake as an input and turn on its module:

```nix
inputs.rewind.url = "github:fzakaria/rewindvm";

# in your configuration, with inputs.rewind.nixosModules.default imported;
# it also adds rewindvm.cachix.org to Nix's substituters
programs.rewind.enable = true;
programs.rewind.app.enable = true;
# AMD only: make the branch counter exact at every boot
programs.rewind.amdBranchCounterWorkaround = true;
```

Or take the tarballs from the
[latest release](https://github.com/fzakaria/rewindvm/releases/latest)
yourself:

```console
# the rewind command, with the VM's kernel
$ curl -L https://github.com/fzakaria/rewindvm/releases/latest/download/rewind-x86_64-linux.tar.gz | tar xz
# the desktop app
$ curl -L https://github.com/fzakaria/rewindvm/releases/latest/download/rewind-app-x86_64-linux.tar.gz | tar xz
# the kernel's debug symbols for rewind gdb, next to the command (150 MB)
$ curl -L https://github.com/fzakaria/rewindvm/releases/latest/download/rewind-debug-x86_64-linux.tar.gz | tar xz
```

`/dev/kvm` must be readable and writable by you. On AMD Ryzen and EPYC, run
`sudo rewind pmu enable` once after each boot so the VM's clock can follow the
work done inside it; [Time inside the VM](docs/pmu.md) explains why.

## Use it

```console
# build a derivation in the VM; the output is checked against the host's
$ rewind nix nixpkgs#hello

# run the derivation under many thread schedules, and name the step that decides a failure
$ rewind check github:fzakaria/rewindvm#mylib

# the same, with the line of code each thread involved was on
$ rewind check --where github:fzakaria/rewindvm#mylib

# how many of 16 schedules from a step of a recorded run end differently,
# each a fork of the run
$ rewind check --run <run> --schedule-from <step> --schedules 16 --all --no-narrow

# any command in a root filesystem: a directory, an erofs image, or a docker export
$ rewind run --root mylib.tar --cwd /src -- make check

# whether this machine can record runs, and what to fix where it cannot
$ rewind doctor

# list runs and look inside one
$ rewind ls
$ rewind show <run>
$ rewind open <run> <step> --compare <other run>
$ rewind log <run> --steps
$ rewind ps <run> <step>
$ rewind cat <run> <step> /build/env-vars

# a shell inside the VM at a step, in a throwaway fork; --with brings more
# Nix packages into it
$ rewind shell <run> <step> --pid <pid>
$ rewind shell <run> <step> --pid <pid> --with nixpkgs#strace

# gdb on a fork at a step, with the symbols and sources of the kernel and of
# the process running there; arguments after -- go to gdb
$ rewind gdb <run> <step>
$ rewind gdb <run> <step> -- -batch -ex 'break pool.c:77' -ex continue -ex bt

# every thread of a process, even with the CPU idle, as at a deadlock
$ rewind gdb <run> <step> --pid <pid> -- -batch -ex 'thread apply all bt'

# the line of the program's own code a thread was on, with its callers: by
# default the thread of the step's event; --json for programs
$ rewind where <run> <step>
$ rewind where <run> <step> --tid <tid> --json

# which thread held the CPU at each step of a window, replayed step by step
$ rewind threads <run> --from <step> --to <step>

# branch a run at a step under another schedule, or replay it exactly
$ rewind fork <run> <step> --schedule 2
$ rewind replay <run>

# remove a run's forks that ran exactly as an older one did
$ rewind prune <run> --identical --dry-run
$ rewind prune <run> --identical

# remove a run and every fork of it, and forks of those
$ rewind remove <run> --dry-run
$ rewind remove <run>

# remove many runs in one call, here every fork, keeping the runs forked from
$ rewind ls | awk '/fork of/ {print $1}' | xargs rewind remove

# remove the cached images and stored pages no run uses any more
$ rewind gc --dry-run
$ rewind gc

# share a run as one file
$ rewind export <run> --replayable
$ rewind import <file>.rwd
$ rewind import https://github.com/fzakaria/rewindvm/releases/download/case-studies/nix-gc-closure-sigpipe-replayable.rwd
```

## The desktop app

The app scrubs a recorded run. Drag the playhead along the timeline and the
build log, process tree and files follow it, or jump to the failure or to
where the run parts from a passing one.

- Click a file to read it as it was at the playhead, syntax colored, or as a
  colored hex dump.
- Show source (`s`) opens the line of the program's own code the thread was
  on, with the stack frames that led there; click a frame to see its line.
  Debug info and sources come from the program itself, or from
  nixseparatedebuginfod2 for Nix packages.
- Search (`Ctrl+F` or `/`) finds text in the build log, the console, file
  paths and events, and takes the playhead to each match.
- Bookmarks (`b`) mark a step with a note, kept with the run and in its
  `.rwd` exports.
- Two runs that differ only in their schedules show the step where the
  schedules part, as a dashed blue mark, and the card says what only one of
  them got there, such as a reschedule.
- The Compare tab sets the two runs' events side by side from just before
  they part, in full, with what differs marked; `x` swaps to the compared
  run at the matching step.
- Show threads (`t`) draws a lane per thread over a window of steps, a bar
  where the thread held the CPU, this run above the compared run.
- Previous and Next can stop at one thread, process, file or kind of event.
- Open shell and Attach gdb work inside the VM at the playhead.
- Fork from here branches the run under another schedule. Its menu turns it
  into Check from here, which tries 8 to 64 schedules from the playhead and
  counts how they ended, a cell per schedule.
- The Runs panel draws a build's runs as a tree of schedules and forks.

```console
$ nix run github:fzakaria/rewindvm#app -- ~/.local/share/rewind/runs/<run>

It opens `.rwd` exports too, from a file or an https URL, and comes with an
example run and a short tour. See [pricing](https://rewindvm.dev/#pricing) for

## Case studies

- [A SIGPIPE in Nix's gc-closure test](docs/case-studies/nix-gc-closure-sigpipe.md):
  Rewind's first run of Nix's functional tests failed in `gc-closure.sh`, a
  flake nobody had reported. A two-line `printf` piped into `head -n1` under
  `pipefail` is two writes, and when `head` exits between them the writer
  dies of SIGPIPE. Rewind narrows the failure to the two steps between those
  writes; on the host the test never failed in 200 runs.
- [A hang in Nix's store schema migration](docs/case-studies/nix-schema-migration-hang.md):
  a known, fixed bug, [NixOS/nix#15693](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/15693),
  reproduced on the version it was reported against. `rewind shell` and gdb
  inside the VM pin it to `SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT` retried inside an open
  transaction, which explains why the first fix did not stop it and the
  second did.
- [Lost task output in devenv](docs/case-studies/devenv-task-output-race.md):
  a known, fixed bug, [cachix/devenv#2281](https://github.com/cachix/devenv/issues/2281),
  where a task's last lines went missing. A test that passed 2000 times on the
  host failed under 216 of 257 schedules, and `rewind gdb` shows the last line
  still in the reader's buffer when `tokio::select!` took the child's exit.
  The fix passes every schedule.

The derivations they run are in
[examples/case-studies/flake.nix](examples/case-studies/flake.nix).

## How it works

The VM has one vCPU on stock KVM, so code in it runs on the real CPU. Its
Linux kernel carries a small Rewind platform: interrupts arrive only when the
VM hands control to Rewind, the clock moves only then, and the timestamp
counter and hardware RNG are hidden. Each of those handoffs is a step, and the
sequence of steps is the same on every run. Inputs, a Nix closure or a root
filesystem, become a read-only erofs image mapped into the VM's memory.
Keyframes of the VM's memory go into a content-addressed page store, so seeking
to any step restores the nearest keyframe and runs forward.

A GNU hello build from nixpkgs runs at close to native speed in the VM, and its
output is bit for bit the one Nix builds on the host.
[Design](docs/design.md) has the details, the limits, and what comes next.

## Develop

```console
$ nix develop                  # the toolchain, with REWIND_KERNEL and REWIND_INITRD set
$ cargo test --workspace
$ cargo run --release -p rewind -- nix nixpkgs#hello
$ nix flake check              # prose, the NixOS module, and a determinism check that needs /dev/kvm
$ nix fmt                      # Nix, Rust, Python, HTML and Markdown
$ nix run .#serve              # the website on a local port
